Under any given date, the reading assignment listed should be prepared for class on that date. So, for example, on Friday, February 5, you should come to class having prepared Homer *Iliad* 1.1-16. Please note that “prepare” does NOT mean “write out a translation” -- in fact, you are expressly forbidden from writing out a translation to bring to class. “Prepare” means to make grammatical notes (identify person, number, tense, voice, and mood of verbs; gender, case, and number of nouns, adjectives, and participles; etc.), mark your Greek text with syntactic and structural aides (parentheses to sequester clauses or phrases, arrows to indicate possession or modification, underlines, circles, etc.), and note down unfamiliar vocab or conjugations or declensions. Writing out a translation means that you’re not actually doing the work of understanding how the Greek works, which is infinitely more important than coming up with a “perfect” translation.
