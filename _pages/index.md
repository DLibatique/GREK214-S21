## Course Description

This semester, we will learn about the world of archaic Greek epic by reading selections of Homerâ€™s Iliad in Greek and selected passages in translation. We will build your syntactic and grammatical knowledge of Homeric Greek, discuss features of Homeric epic like formulae and the oral tradition, expand your reading comprehension beyond surface-level translation, practice reciting Greek in dactylic hexameter, and explore the rich relationships between characters like Achilles and Patroclus. Our reading list includes selections from Books 1, 16, 18, and 22.
